HEY! DON'T YOU KNOW IT'S RUDE TO LOOK THROUGH OTHER PEOPLES' FILES?!

I'm just kidding, thank you for not only playing the mod, but also looking through the lore folder. It's mostly just a lot of random stuff that is somewhat related to the mod, along with other misc stuff I decided to throw it for the fun of it.

Fr tho, thank you so much for checking out this mod, it means the world to me that you'd give this little one-shot the time of day. A lot of work went into this, so it's nice to know that it wasn't for nothing.

Also, yes, I did steal the lore folder concept from SFG, thank you for asking :)
